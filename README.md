# 📊 OECD Income & Education Analysis

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Global income inequality remains a persistent issue influenced by a range of factors, including **educational attainment, age, gender, and geography**. Despite the availability of large-scale public datasets like those from the OECD, many countries fail to leverage this information to guide policy. This project seeks to answer:

- How does education level impact income?
- Are there systematic gender disparities in earnings?
- Do income levels differ by age across countries?
- Which regions demonstrate greater fairness in income distribution?

## 🔍 Analytical Approach

Using OECD data covering **44 countries and regions**, we applied the following steps:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and harmonised raw datasets.
- Transformed structure for country-age-gender-education-income alignment.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Bar Charts**: Income differences across countries.
- **Stacked Charts**: Gender-based comparisons within education levels.
- **Line & Scatter Plots**: Age-income trajectories and trends.

### 3. Comparative Regional Analysis
- Grouped countries by region (e.g., Western Europe, Latin America).
- Evaluated relative fairness in income and representation.

### 4. Insight Synthesis
- Summarised patterns using visualisation and statistics.
- Linked demographic trends with structural inequalities.

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the findings, we recommend:

- **Expand access to higher education**  
  ➤ Income is strongly linked to tertiary education (ISCED 5–8).

- **Tackle structural gender disparities**  
  ➤ Strengthen legislation and promote pay transparency.

- **Support career development across ages**  
  ➤ Implement lifelong learning to counter age-based income stagnation.

- **Adopt regional best practices**  
  ➤ Countries with high inequality can learn from Nordic policy models.

## ✅ Outcomes

- 📈 **Tertiary education significantly increases earnings** across all countries.
- 👨‍🦰👩 **Men consistently earn more than women**, even with equivalent education.
- ⏳ **Income peaks at 45–54 age group**, then plateaus or declines.
- 🌍 **Northern & Western Europe show fairer distributions**, while other regions show greater disparity.
