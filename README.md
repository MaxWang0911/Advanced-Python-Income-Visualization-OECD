OECD Income & Education Analysis
üìå Problem Statement
Global income inequality remains a persistent issue influenced by a range of factors, including educational attainment, age, gender, and geography. Despite the availability of large-scale public datasets like those from the OECD, many countries fail to leverage this information to guide policy. This project seeks to answer:

How does education level impact income?

Are there systematic gender disparities in earnings?

Do income levels differ by age across countries?

Which regions demonstrate greater fairness in income distribution?

üîç Analytical Approach
Using OECD data covering 44 countries and regions, we applied the following steps:

Data Preparation:
Cleaned and reshaped raw data to extract consistent indicators across demographics (age, gender, education) and income metrics.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used visual tools such as:

Bar charts for average income by country

Stacked bar charts for gender-based income comparison

Scatter plots and line charts for trends across age groups

Comparative Analysis:
Grouped countries by region (e.g., Western Europe, Latin America) to examine fairness and disparities.

Synthesis of Findings:
Highlighted key correlations and patterns using statistical summaries and visual storytelling.

üí° Recommendations
Based on the findings, we propose the following:

Expand access to higher education:
As income increases significantly with educational attainment, especially tertiary education, public investment in accessible higher education is critical.

Address structural gender disparities:
Implement stronger equal pay legislation and transparent salary reporting to reduce persistent gender gaps.

Tailor career development support by age group:
Career support programs should recognize the income plateau post age 45, and promote continuous upskilling.

Target region-specific reforms:
Countries with higher inequality (e.g., Latin America, Eastern Europe) should adopt policy models from fairer systems (e.g., Nordic countries).

‚úÖ Outcomes
This analysis reveals that:

Education is the strongest predictor of higher income, across all countries.

Gender pay gaps persist globally, even among the most educated populations.

Income typically peaks between ages 45‚Äì54, with country-specific variations.

Northern and Western European countries show more equitable income distributions.

By transforming raw OECD data into actionable insights, this project supports data-driven policymaking and encourages the public to better understand global socioeconomic dynamics.
