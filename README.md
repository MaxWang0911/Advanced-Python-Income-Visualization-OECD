# Advanced Python: Income Visualization Across OECD Countries

This project explores income disparities across 44 OECD countries and regions using Python. By applying data wrangling and visualization techniques, we examine how income is influenced by education, age, and gender across nations.

## 🎯 Objectives

Using a real-world dataset from the OECD, we address the following questions:

- Are there income disparities between countries?
- How does educational attainment affect average salaries?
- Are there gender differences in starting salaries across education levels?
- Does income increase with age, and is this trend different by gender?
- How do age, gender, and education distribute across income brackets?
- Which countries or regions have more income fairness?

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Grouped aggregations and categorical comparisons
- Distribution plots, violin plots, stacked bar charts, facet grids
- Cross-country and cross-demographic visualization
- HTML-based final report

## 📁 Files

- `Earnings_Data_OECD.csv` — Source dataset  
- `Income_Analysis_OECD_Notebook.ipynb` — Python code and analysis  
- `OECD_Income_Analysis_Report.html` — Rendered final report  

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Educational attainment has a strong positive impact on income across all age and gender groups
- Gender pay gaps persist across all education levels and grow with age
- Regional differences show varied levels of income fairness
